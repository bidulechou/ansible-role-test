This project is not an application but a set of examples for testing ansible roles tutorial live demo.
Its first goal has been to serve as running example when I tried to build a CI pipeline dedicated to test ansible roles.

### Testing Ansible Roles ###

* Set of runnable examples using [rolespec](https://github.com/nickjj/rolespec) as test library framework to perform unit tests of Ansible roles.
* Version: 0.1
* [Learn Markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo)

### First Steps in Ansible Roles Unit Testing ###

### Prerequisites:
What you need:
* first to clone *rolespec* in your favorite tool's place, it will help you create your first role test (even on Windows).
* to clone this repository in your own workspace
* a Linux shell, *Git Bash* is a good candidate but with a little restriction which needs a fix.
* a Docker Machine (@see: [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/)).
* a customized Ansible docker image which will run tests automatically at runtime.
